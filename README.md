# Fairness in Link Analysis Algorithms - Budgeted PageRank Fairness

Algorithms are increasingly used to make important decisions that have significant impact on people’s lives. As a result, the issue of algorithmic fairness has raised numerous concerns and received much interest recently. In this diploma thesis, we consider fairness for link analysis algorithms and, in particular, for the celebrated PageRank algorithm. The PageRank algorithm was introduced by the Google search engine, but it is also used for a variety of applications, such as, recommendations. Given a network where the nodes in belong to groups (for example, based on demographic or other characteristics), PageRank fairness asks for a fair allocation of the PageRank weights to the minority (protected) group. For this purpose, modified PageRank algorithms have been proposed that impose a fair behavior to the entire set of nodes from which the network consists of. In this diploma thesis, we purse fairness with the least possible changes and hence, with a lower cost. Therefore, we gradually render “fair” nodes, until we achieve fairness. We provide analytical formulas for computing the effect of such nodes on fairness and consider the utility loss with respect to the original PageRank algorithm. Finally, we present experiments with real networks that examine fairness, as well as experimentally evaluate our formulas.
