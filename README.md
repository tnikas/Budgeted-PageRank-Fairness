Algorithms are increasingly used to make important decisions that have significant
impact on people’s lives. As a result, the issue of algorithmic fairness has raised
numerous concerns and received much interest recently. In this diploma thesis, we
consider fairness for link analysis algorithms and, in particular, for the celebrated
PageRank algorithm. Given a network where the nodes in belong to groups (for example, based on demographic or
other characteristics), PageRank fairness asks for a fair allocation of the PageRank
weights to the minority (protected) group. For this purpose, modified PageRank
algorithms have been proposed that impose a fair behavior to the entire set of nodes
from which the network consists of. In this diploma thesis, we purse fairness with the
least possible changes and hence, with a lower cost. Therefore, we gradually render
“fair” nodes, until we achieve fairness. We provide analytical formulas for computing the
effect of such nodes on fairness and consider the utility loss with respect to the original
PageRank algorithm. Finally, we present experiments with real networks that examine
fairness, as well as experimentally evaluate our formulas.
